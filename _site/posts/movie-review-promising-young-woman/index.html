    <p>TL:DR; Incredibly disappointing</p>
<p>I had high hopes for this film. Since it is being nominated for...</p>
<p>Best Motion Picture of the Year</p>
<p>Best Achievement in Directing</p>
<p>Best Original Screenplay</p>
<p>Best Achievement in Film Editing</p>
<p>at the OSCARS</p>
<p>Who know who else won Best Motion Picture? The Godfather in <strong>1973</strong></p>
<p>Promising Young Woman does not even breath the same air as the Godfather.</p>
<p>Whoever nominated Promising Young Woman for so many awards must have been high, because this movie has so many things wrong with it.</p>
<p>The IMDB description is as follows &quot;A young woman, traumatized by a tragic event in her past, seeks out vengeance against those who crossed her path.&quot;</p>
<p>So its a revenge film right?</p>
<p>This movie was so bad I can't even finish this review, i'll have to come back to it later.</p>
