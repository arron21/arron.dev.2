    <p>So you are a software developer, artist, creative.</p>
<p>You have great ideas and would love to see your ideas come to life in the workplace.</p>
<p>You want to build, you want to create!</p>
<p>Yet the company you work for doesn't see eye to eye with your vision.</p>
<p>You get frustrated.</p>
<p>you get burnt out.</p>
<p>There is a very simple strategy to not feeling this way.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Stop trying to implement the new ways of doing things, your new ideas, your creativity.</p>
<p>But, don't stop it entirely!</p>
<p>Just stop doing it at your job.</p>
<p>Some jobs encourage creativity and new solutions, and some jobs do not.</p>
<p>Instead of wasting your energy trying to move a rock that won't move, start using your creativity in a different project.</p>
<p>Create something brand new.
Creativity is a terrible thing to waste, so don't waste it.</p>
<p>If you are going to use your creative energy use it for something you can be proud of, something that is yours. Something that is entirely your idea.</p>
