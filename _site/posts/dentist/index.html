    <p>I went to the dentist yesterday. I had not been to the dentist in a couple years so I figured I was overdue for a cleaning.</p>
<p>Turns out I was only getting x-rays on this initial visit and I have to go back for a cleaning next week. I have 1 cavity on the side of one of my teeth; I had not noticed it before.</p>
<p>They also want me to consult an oral surgeon because they think my wisdom teeth are going to become an issue in the future. Due to their angle, they will push horizontally on my other teeth which will cause crowding probably.</p>
<p>I also learned that gums don’t grow back, once your gums start receding they stay receded.</p>
<p>It must be pretty boring to read about someone else’s teeth.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason I am writing this is to drive in one simple point… Take Care of Yourself.</p>
<p>I tend to put off things like going to the dentist and doctor simply because it is not very convenient and it interferes with work, but the reality of the situation is my gums are not growing back, my teeth are not growing back, and I am not getting any younger.</p>
<p>The code I write day to day might be used for a while, but eventually, it will probably be discarded for new code. The hours I spend working on a project might be good practice for becoming a better programmer, but not spending enough time taking care of the vessel that holds that brain is going to cause major problems sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Major problems will become bigger and more expensive the longer you let them fester.</p>
<p>I am not just talking about physical health, but mental health as well. It is all too easy to push ourselves to be overworked and dedicate too much thought to our work both in and out of the office.</p>
