    <p>I have replied to the 14 points detailed by Dr. Lawrence Britt on the 'Defining Points of Fascism'</p>
<p>1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Nationalism is definitely a strong theme in the Trump administration. Tightening of the borders and a general negative mentality towards immigration.</p>
<p>2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of &quot;need.&quot; The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>On the subject of immigration there has been reports of “camps” at the border and inhumane treatment of those attempting to immigrate illegally.</p>
<p>3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Calling all other parties that are not Trump ‘Communist’ and ‘Socialist’ is a common message. Currently it Trump has even been blaming the previous presidential administration for some things.</p>
<p>4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Need to research this more</p>
<p>5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>With Pence as Vice President the Trump administration tailors to a a specific sect of Christianity that focus on specific policies such as Pro-Life and abortion law. These types of Religious laws apply more to the religion point below</p>
<p>6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Calling the media ‘Fake News’ has been a strategy of Trump since before he ran for President. Most recently he has Tweeted that some online platforms (Twitter, ironically) need to be controlled. If the Trump administration actually plans on making major changes to any Social platform during their term I worry it will be the most damning and obvious step towards a truly Facist Administration.</p>
<p>7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This is a major tool/excuse for the illegal immigrant border wall. While illegal immigration is technically an issue, it is not an issue of National Security… at least not in the sense that our Nation is truly at risk and requires mobilization of forces.</p>
<p>8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed</p>
<p>to the government's policies or actions.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This has been a problem in America for decades and it is more apparent now than ever. I am ashamed we have let our Government become so religiously focused. All people should be free to practice their religion, and the Government should not have anymore to do with it than that 1st amendment.</p>
<p>9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This is also a huge problem in America for decades.</p>
<p>More on this later.</p>
<p>10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Need to research more</p>
<p>11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>We are not quite here yet. Some interesting statistics might be to check the college education level of Trump voters.</p>
<p>12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ICE, Immigration, is an example of a government police that is abusing its power. General Police have also been abusing their power for far too long.</p>
<p>13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Trump’s entire family is in some way involved in White House business, it is blatant nepotism.</p>
<p>14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This is something that can’t be proven yet.</p>
<p>I do worry that the democratic process in the USA has been at risk for many decades already.</p>
<p>It was proven that Russia interfered in order to help Trump get elected in 2016. Trump will not complain about this because he only cares about winning, not about the sovereignty of the USA.</p>
