    <p>When we think of the internet and we think of design, we generally use the  term &quot;Web Design&quot;.</p>
<p>I'd like to explain how there are actually two very different realms of web design.</p>
<h2>Website Design</h2>
<p>Website design exists in the category of the internet that is more informational and to an extend more marketing focused. Website design only aims to accomplish the following...</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture and hold the user's attention</li>
<li>Convey specific information to the user</li>
<li>Possibly convince the user to do something, aka the Call to Action</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web App Design</h2>
<p>Web app design exists in the category of the internet that is more goal based. This differs from the informational base by 1 key difference... Users coming to a web app have a reason to go to the web app.</p>
<p>For example, when logging onto Facebook, the user has a clear reason to go to Facebook. They either want to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share an update on their profile</li>
<li>View updates on someone else's profile</li>
<li>Be barraged with hundreds of advertisements</li>
</ul>
<h3>The key difference</h3>
<p>A website is trying to sell you something, a web app is trying to help you accomplish something.</p>
<h3>UI/UX</h3>
<p>User interaction and user experience can differ greatly between the two realms of design, and they should.</p>
<p>There are are a few tradition paradigms of website designs such as the <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-the-f-layout-in-web-design--webdesign-687">F-layout </a> and then there are more experimental approaches to website design; a good place to find more experimental designs is <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a></p>
<p>Websites tend to be a place where designers are more free to show off and experiment, whereas web apps  generally don't have the affordance to be as crazy.</p>
<h3>In conclusion</h3>
<p>It is okay for there to be differences between website and web app design, in fact there should definitely be differences between the two.</p>
